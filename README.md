## Hello! 📈

I am an experienced data scientist and business strategist with a Master's of Science in Statistics. Much of my experience has been in sponsorship market research, tidying, visualizing, and analyzing data. 

After being the first hire at Wakefield, the company has grown 20X. I have led our data engineering efforts on the backend allowing for ease of processing new client data and on the front end I have developed and designed our deliverables for clients. One of my favorite projects was automating the creation of our surveys using various API calls in R.

- 🔭 Beyond business and applied statistics, I enjoy reading and thiking about theology, philosophy, ethics, and public health.
- 🌲 I enjoy spending time outdoors as much as possible or in the gym trying not to hurt myself.
- 💻 I am open to any freelance or volunteer work in the reporting/data analysis/statistics realm as I have time!
- 📫 Message me on LinkedIn or send me an email (ianchanceyoung [at] gmail [dot] com).
- 🐻 Sic'Em Bears!
