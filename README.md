## Hello! 📈

I am an experienced applied statistician/analytics professional with a Master's of Science in Statistics. Much of my experience has been in sponsorship market research, tidying, visualizing, and analyzing data. 

After being the first hire at Wakefield, the company has grown 20X, and I have also dabbled in product development and business strategy over the years. However, I am not sure anything is quite as fun as polishing a graphic or writing clean, readable code. We are a little sparse here on GitHub, but I am hoping to have more shareable projects up in the future!

- 🔭 Beyond business and applied statistics, I enjoy reading and thiking about theology, philosophy, ethics, and public health.
- 🌲 I enjoy spending time outdoors as much as possible or in the gym trying not to hurt myself.
- 💻 I open to any freelance or volunteer work in the reporting/data analysis/statistics realm as I have time!
- 📫 Message me on LinkedIn or send me an email (ianchanceyoung [at] gmail [dot] com.
- 🐻 Sic'Em Bears!
